# Midwest Alliance for Applied Genomic Epidemiology

The Midwest Alliance for Applied Genomic Epidemiology (MAAGE) is a collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory, the Illinois Department of Public Health, and the University of Illinois. The goal of the MAAGE is to develop a genomic surveillance and epidemiology platform to enable state and local public health agencies to detect and track the spread of infectious diseases with greater sensitivity and to provide educational material to help the public health and healthcare community to use this platform for their everyday work.
