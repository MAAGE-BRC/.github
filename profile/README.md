# Midwest Alliance for Applied Genomic Epidemiology

Welcome to the GitHub Organization for the MAAGE!

The Midwest Alliance for Applied Genomic Epidemiology is a collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory, the Illinois Department of Public Health, and the University of Illinois. Our goal is to develop a genomic surveillance and epidemiology platform to enable state and local public health agencies to detect and track the spread of infectious diseases with greater sensitivity and to provide educational material to help the public health and healthcare community to use this platform for their everyday work.
